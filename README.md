## Disclaimer

This is my personal configuration, it is not meant be used by anybody else. You can be sure that sooner than later it will breaks.

It is not forbidden, but it would be probably very stupid to do it.

Feel free, to take snippets of code you might need, or to tell me if I am doing something wrong, I probably do.

## This configuration should have the following feature

Clone the repo :

```shell
git clone git@github.com:sinarf/dotnvim.git .config/nvim
```
