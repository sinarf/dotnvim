## Disclaimer

This is my personal configuration, it is not meant be used by anybody else. It is not forbidden but probably very stupid.

If you need something more complete you should look at what @ChristianChiarulli work, especially the [Neovim from scratch repo](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch).
I took a lot of inspiration from that repository.
