## Disclaimer

This is my personal configuration, it is not meant be used by anybody else.

It is not forbidden, but it would be probably very stupid to do it.
I like to adapt all the time add or removing stuff.

Feel free, to take snippets of code you might need, or to tell me if I am doing something wrong, I probably do.

## What I use neovim for

I am a CI engineer, I do mostly scripting in bash, Python, Groovy.
